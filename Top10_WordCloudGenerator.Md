Looking for a tool to generate visual representations out of the text data? A sophisticated word cloud generator is all you need to create shapes using words and only words, taken from the supplied text. The most useful the word is in the text, the more prominent it appears on the generated word cloud.

There are many word cloud generators out there in the wild and selecting one can be a difficult task, fortunately most of these are free, so you can try out as many before you settle for the one that fits your requirements and liking.

## Which Word Cloud Generator is Good for you?

It all depends on what features you are looking for, a typical tool to create word cloud can take input text from multiple sources including web page URL, copy pasting text directly in the cloud editor or by uploading a document. Talking about features of the popular word cloud maker, it can create multiple shapes, use different fonts, colors, themes, provide clickable links on words and options to export in multiple file formats.

Additional features include exporting to SVG, PDF, using Google fonts, generating HD images, transparent backgrounds, adjusting orientation and gap between words, using custom background image and more. Sophisticated tools also let you save your creations in the cloud and share directly on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Email or embed in an online webpage.

Word cloud generators are quite popular and used a lot by students, professors, analysts, illustrators and presenters in general. Let us look at the 10 best tools out there in the wild that are feature rich and highly rated by users.  

Before I continue with the various tools below, it is important to mention that the all-time popular Wordle creator Wordle.net, but starting this year, it is not working properly in many browsers, due to some recent Java Applet related security concerns. The developers of Wordle.net have not fixed the issue yet (you can check again though), and for that reason, it is listed towards the end in this article.

### 1. WordArt.com (Formerly Tagul)

Wordart.com is one of the most feature rich and popular word cloud generator out there in the wild. It started back in 2010 with the name Tagul and was recently rebranded as Wordart.com. Ever after its rebranding as Wordart.com, it has grown leaps and bounds in popularity and is used around the globe by students, teachers, bloggers and presenters to create beautiful looking word arts.

ABCya is the leader in educational games for kids and offers a word cloud generator as well, which is specifically designed for parents and teachers to help children in education and learning.

ABCya has a toolbar and a unique sliding bar feature which helps you manipulate and customize the word cloud you have generated in a very intuitive manner.  You can create New word cloud, edit existing, Save, print, apply word filters, set word limit, choose layouts like triangle, star, square, heart etc., define colors and fonts.
